                    Mathematics is the science that deals with the logic of shape,
                    quantity and arrangement. Math is all around us, in everything we do.
                    It is the building block for everything in our daily lives, 
                    including mobile devices, architecture (ancient and modern), art, money, engineering, and even sports.

                    Science can be divided into different branches based on the subject of study. 
                    The physical sciences study the inorganic world and comprise the fields of astronomy, 
                    chemistry, and the Earth sciences. The biological sciences such as biology and medicine study the organic
                    world of life and its processes.

                    English is a languageâ€”originally the language of the people of England.
                    Today, English is the main language of the United Kingdom, Ireland,
                    the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and more than fifty other countries. 
                    (Interestingly, English is NOT the official language of the USA)
